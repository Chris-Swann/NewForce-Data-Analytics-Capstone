# 🏃‍♂️ Ultramarathon Performance Analytics

## 📌 Capstone Overview

This project is part of the **NewForce Data Analytics Capstone** and focuses on analyzing ultramarathon performance across two major qualification pathways:

- **Golden Ticket races** for the [Western States 100](https://www.wser.org/)
- **UTMB World Series races** for the [UTMB Finals](https://utmb.world/)

The goal is to uncover trends in how top performers from these qualifying events fare at the Western States and UTMB finals, while also examining environmental factors and gender distribution.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze performance outcomes of Golden Ticket and UTMB World Series qualifiers
- Identify which races yield the strongest or most consistent results
- Explore how **temperature**, **elevation**, and **terrain** impact finishing times and DNF (Did Not Finish) rates
- Examine **gender distribution** and competitiveness across events

---

## 🧰 Current Progress

- ✅ Built two custom web scrapers:
  - `ultrasignup_scraper.py` for Golden Ticket race results
  - `utmb_scraper.py` for UTMB World Series race results
- ✅ Initial data cleaning and normalization underway
- 🔜 Integration of weather and elevation data via API
- 🔜 Exploratory analysis of gender and DNF trends
