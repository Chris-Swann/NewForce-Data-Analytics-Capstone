    "# 🌦️ Weather Data Extraction for Race Events\n",
    "\n",
    "This script fetches historical weather data for race events using the Visual Crossing Weather API. It reads race coordinates and dates from a CSV file, queries the weather API, and writes the results to a new CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📋 What This Script Does\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reads race name, date, latitude, and longitude from an input CSV file.\n",
    "- Sends a request to the Visual Crossing API for weather data on the specified date and location.\n",
    "- Extracts key weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, dew point, wind speed, and conditions.\n",
    "- Writes the results to an output CSV file for further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🛠️ Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Before running the script, make sure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A valid **Visual Crossing API key**. You can get one from your [Visual Crossing account page](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api).\n",
    "- Python packages: `requests`, `csv`\n",
    "- An input CSV file with the following columns:\n",
    "  - `Race_Name`\n",
    "  - `Race_Date` (format: YYYY-MM-DD, Required by Visual Crossing)\n",
    "  - `Latitude`\n",
    "  - `Longitude`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📁 File Paths\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Input file**: `../data/race_coordinates/race_coordinates.csv`\n",
    "- **Output file**: `weather_output.csv` (Rename as needed)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📦 Output Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The output CSV will include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Race_Name`\n",
    "- `Race_Date`\n",
    "- `Latitude`\n",
    "- `Longitude`\n",
    "- `TempMax`\n",
    "- `TempMin`\n",
    "- `Humidity`\n",
    "- `DewPoint`\n",
    "- `WindSpeed`\n",
    "- `Precipitation`\n",
    "- `CloudCover`\n",
    "- `Conditions`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ▶️ How to Run\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Replace `'API_KEY'` in the script with your actual Visual Crossing API key.\n",
    "2. Ensure your input CSV is correctly formatted and located at the specified path.\n",
    "3. Run the script within a Jupyter Notebook cell."
